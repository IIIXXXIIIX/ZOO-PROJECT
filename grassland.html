<h1>Grassland</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/grassland">A herd of antelope moves slowly through the tall grass. Suddenly a cheetah leaps from its hiding place, and the animals zig and zag across the savanna. They make it to a small grove of scrubby trees, but they can’t let their guard down yet. It’s the end of the rainy season and the antelopes—like many animals on the grasslands—must leave their protected place and migrate across open grasslands to find water.</blockquote>

<h2>Pairie dogs</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://www.marylandzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Prairie-Dog-Profile-1.jpg"> Prairie dogs (genus Cynomys) are herbivorous burrowing ground squirrels native to the grasslands of North America. Within the genus are five species: black-tailed, white-tailed, Gunnison's, Utah, and Mexican prairie dogs.[3] In Mexico, prairie dogs are found primarily in the northern states, which lie at the southern end of the Great Plains: northeastern Sonora, north and northeastern Chihuahua, northern Coahuila, northern Nuevo León, and northern Tamaulipas. In the United States, they range primarily to the west of the Mississippi River, though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales. They are also found in the Canadian Prairies. Despite the name, they are not actually canines; prairie dogs, along with the marmots, chipmunks, and several other basal genera belong to the ground squirrels (tribe Marmotini), part of the larger squirrel family (Sciuridae).</blockquote>

<h2>Cheetah</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah">The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa, central Iran and India (reintroduced). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); as such, it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. It typically reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Four subspecies are recognised.</blockquote
