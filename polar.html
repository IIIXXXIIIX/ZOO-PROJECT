<h1>Polar</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/polar">It’s frigid and you’re surrounded by ice. You wonder how any animal could survive in this extreme cold. Then a polar bear and her cubs lumber by, and in the ocean behind them a whale erupts from the water.</blockquote>

<h2>artic fox</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear"> `The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also known as the white fox, polar fox, or snow fox, is a small fox that belongs to the family of Canidae, native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome.[1][7][8][9] It is well adapted to living in cold environments, and is best known for its thick, warm fur that is also used as camouflage. It has a large and very fluffy tail. In the wild, most individuals do not live past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to 11 years.[10] Its body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm (18 to 27 in), with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat.</blockquote>

<h2>polar bear </h2>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox">The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.</blockquote
